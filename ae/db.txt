From Sec. 4 of the soon-to-be-published Nuclear Fusion paper:
A large database has been assembled from 1112 DIII-D discharges acquired between 2008-2019.  To ensure different values of
q profile and to facilitate mode classification, selected times  in  the  discharge  are  all  during  the  first  1.9  s  
of  the  discharge,  when  the q profile steadily evolves.  Selected experiments had a wide variety of purposes but nearly
 all dedicated  energetic  particle  experiments  are  included.   Time  slices  are  chosen  to  sample either different 
plasma conditions or different types of mode activity,  so a given discharge  may  have  only  a  single  entry  or  as  
many  as  nine  entries.   Selected  conditions span  plasma  current Ip≤1.6  MA,  toroidal  field  0.5≤BT≤2.1,  normalized 
 beta0.1≤βN≤3.2,  elongation  1.1≤κ≤2.2,  triangularity−0.4< delta <1.0,  line-averaged ensity 0.4×1019≤ ̄ne≤5.0×1019m−3, 
central  lectron temperature Te<7.6 keV, and central ion temperature Ti<11.4 keV. Plasmas in both L-mode and H-mode are included.

All discharges utilize deuterium neutral beam injection into a deuterium plasma; carbon is the dominant impurity in the
 graphite-wall vessel. Observed instabilities are classified as either EAE, TAE, RSAE, BAE, LFM, or EGAM. To classify the
 modes, ECE, interferometer, and magnetics cross-power spectra are typically examined. (If ECE is unavailable due to low
 field or high density, BES is examined instead.) Many discharges have steady low-frequency kinks or tearing modes 
with n >0 that are not included in the database.  Modes classified as a LFM have a Christmas light pattern similar to
 the ones in the dedicated experiment.  To facilitate identification, the ECE data are subdivided into three different
 spatial regions and analytical formulas for the BAAE,BAE, RSAE, and TAE frequencies are overlaid on the spectra.  
(However, because the q profile is not always known accurately and RSAEs are readily recognized, when RSAEs are unstable,
 they are the primary guide to identification.)

The database is created by create_db.pro in the area /fusion/projects/xpsi/energetic_particles/heidbrin/BAAE on iris.
It is called db.idl

Of course, shot & time are the selected timeslice.

There are subjective instability "flags" for the six types of instability: EGAM, BAAE (=LFM), BAE, RSAE, TAE, EAE.
-1 means that it wasn't possible to assign a value with sufficient confidence. (For example, when the EAE frequency exceeds
                                           the ECE Nyquist frequency.)
0  means stable

1 means marginal; this might be coming & going or quite weak

2 means unstable for everything except the BAAE.  (For the BAAE, I later decided some of the modes I was calling
                                                   unstable were actually kinks or tearing modes.)

3 means the Christmas light pattern for the BAAE.  In hindsight, this is the equivalent of 2 for the other modes.

3 means rapid frequency chirping for the BAE.  In hindsight, virtually all BAE chirp but it's not always evident if the
                           FFT uses too many time points.  For the BAE, I now call both 2 & 3 "unstable."

-------------------
fbaae, fbae, frsae, and ftae are from the analytical formulas for these frequencies (kHz) in Van Zeeland's
NF 56 (2016) 112007. The plasma parameters that are utilized are the average of the rho=0 and rho=0.5 values.
frot is the rotation frequency averaged the same way.

tenergy0 and tenergym  is the 1/e energy slowing-down time (in seconds) using the expression in the NRL formulary using the
power-weighted injection energy for either rho=0 or rho=0.5.  

tpas0 and tpasm  are the same thing for the 90-degree perpendicular deflection time.  
     (pas stands for "pitch-angle scattering.")

These use zipfit profiles for density, Te, Ti, toroidal rotation, and impurity density.  
In all cases, there is a central value (e.g., te0), a rho=0.5 value (e.g., tem), and a gradient (e.g., tesl).
The gradient is the minimum value of the fitted profile between rho=0.3 and 0.5.
